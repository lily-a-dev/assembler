# assembler
/*
 * This is a university project. For the purpose of this project, the university 
 * has defined a custom assembly syntax.
 *
 * This program receives a list of .as files (through the command-line) and,
 * should the code be valid, create a .ob file with the code encoded to hex.
 * In addition, should the code refer to other files, the program would create
 * .ent and .ext files that list those references.
 * If the code is invalid, the program would print the first error of each line.
